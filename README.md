SQL Project: Supply Chain Optimization

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing supplier performance, optimizing inventory management, and improving order processing efficiency using SQL queries. The objective is to enhance business logistics and inventory operations through data-driven insights.

Key Objectives:
1. Supplier Analysis: Evaluate supplier revenue and delivery times to identify top-performing suppliers, leading to better collaboration and logistics efficiency.
2. Inventory Forecasting: Implement inventory forecasting models to reduce excess inventory and stockouts by setting accurate reordering thresholds.
3. Order Processing Efficiency: Analyze order status and shipment durations to streamline processes, reducing bottlenecks and improving overall order efficiency.
4. Trend Analysis: Conduct trend analysis on seasonal demand and customer preferences to optimize inventory and procurement strategies, improving demand forecasting accuracy.
